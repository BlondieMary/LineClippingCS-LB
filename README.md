# LineClippingCS-LB
Cohen-Sutherland vs. Liang-Barsky line clipping algorithm

In this project we will compare and talk about line clipping algorithms. In particular, we will
deal with two of our most well-known algorithms, Cohen-Sutherland and Liang-Barsky.
For this comparison, we created an experiment in which each time we use one of the two
line-clipping algorithms, including an arbitrary, straight-line generator.
